Welcome to the new decade!

[2020.02.15]
A few things have changed since the 2018 plans and previous diary entries.

Here seem to be the priorities for the year (plus or minus) ahead:

* Dev environments and WFA (work from anywhere) - new list and notes below
* API development - cannot let this languish any longer
* Docker / Kubernetes / Service Meshes - need to document stuff so I don't forget it (again)
* DevOps - get a toolchain working and understand the pitfalls of CI
* Cloud deployments and lifecycle management of applications

I (again) re-installed a Linux chroot image on my ASUS Chromebook, this one is a Ubuntu Linux distro, Xenial. The previous one, once again, for some reason was not working. This install is less bare-bones than the last one -- at least it has an X11 window manager. In the spirit of WFA, I really ought to document what it takes to make this a usable dev environment.

In 2019, I learned the basics of Go and Python. Go is very promising for API development, long term, and I love its combination of simplicity and power. Python is just useful, but for some reason not fascinating.

What follows is an updated minimal stack of developer tools:

* Atom (editor)
* git client
* NodeJS and NPM * with a TBD base set of libraries
* Java 8 * with a TBD base set of libraries
* Golang toolchain
* Docker
* chromium
* An adequate build ecosystem
* Consistent, sustainable access to a cloud-based repository

Dropped: Password Safe [can take care of this via other environments]
Added: Consistent access to a cloud repository
